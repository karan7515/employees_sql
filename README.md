# employees_sql
SQL code for employees data analysis.
Here I downloaded an open-source public dataset (http://www.cs.aau.dk/TimeCenter/Data/employeeTemporalDataSet.zip) containing information about employees.
Used SQL code to analyze the dataset & then storing the obtained results in an excel file for further visualization.
